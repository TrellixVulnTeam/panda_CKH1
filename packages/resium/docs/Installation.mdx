# Installation

## 1. Install cesium and resium

You can install `cesium` and `resium` from npm.

```sh
npm install --save cesium resium
```

**Note**: If you are using TypeScript, install `@types/cesium` also. Installing `@types/resium` is unnecessary as type definitions are built-in.

## 2. Set up webpack configuration

To use Cesium in webpack env, preparation is a bit more necessary, because Cesium includes many asset files and uses AMD as module system.

**Note**: If you are using `create-react-app`, ejecting is required.

There are two options. Choose one. 

1. [Copy whole Cesium files and load Cesium in HTML](/installation1) (easier)
2. [Copy only asset files and load Cesium partially](/installation2)

## 3. Ready

Everything is ready! Advance to [Getting Started](/getting_started).
