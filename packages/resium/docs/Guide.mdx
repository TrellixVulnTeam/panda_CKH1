## Component Lifecycle

Resium brings React's component lifecycle to Cesium. The relationship between Cesium elements and React's lifecycle is as follows.

1. `constructor`: The Cesium element is initialized (the Cesium element of some components are initialized at mount time).
2. `render`: Nothing is rendered, because the object passed to children via React's context API does not exist in this time.
3. `componentDidMount`: The Cesium element is mounted. After this, `forceUpdate` is called and re-render children.
4. `render`: Children of the component are rendered. DOM never be rendered except root components (Viewer and CesiumWidget).
5. `componentDidUpdate`: Changed properties of the Cesium element are updated. If "Cesium read only properties" are changed, the Cesium element will be reinitialized.
6. `componentWillUnmount`: The Cesium element is unmounted and destroyed.

## Context

Some components provide some Cesium elements to children via React's context API. Many components use the closest component's context. If the context does not exists, components are not rendered.

All components except root components have to be mounted inside root components. Root components are `Viewer` and `CesiumWidget`.

For example:

If `Entity` component is mounted under `Viewer` component, an Entity object is added to `Viewer#entities`.

```jsx
<Viewer>
  <Entity />
</Viewer>
```

is equivalent to

```js
const viewer = new Cesium.Viewer();
const entity = new Cesium.Entity();

viewer.entities.add(entity);
```

If `Entity` component is mounted under `CustomDataSource` component, an Entity object is added to `CustomDataSource#entities`. At that time, the CustomDataSource object is added to `Viewer#dataSources`. Of course `CustomDataSource` component should be under `Viewer` component.

```jsx
<Viewer>
  <CustomDataSource>
    <Entity />
  </CustomDataSource>
</Viewer>
```

is equivalent to

```js
const viewer = new Cesium.Viewer();
const dataSource = new Cesium.CustomDataSource();
const entity = new Cesium.Entity();

customDataSource.entities.add(entity);
viewer.dataSources.add(dataSource);
```

Such cases are also in other components. For details, refer to "Available scope" in the document of each component.

## Component location

Please place each component as close as possible under Viewer or CesiumWidget component to avoid extra rendering. Make component hierarchy shallow as possible.

Exception are:

- `Entity` > `*Graphics`
- `Entity` > `EntityDescription`
- `ScreenSpaceEventHandler` > `ScreenSpaceEvent`
- `xCollection` > `x`
- `CustomDataSource` > `Entity`
- `GroundPrimitiveCollection` > `GroundPrimitive`

e.g.: `Scene` > `Camera` or `Camera` > `Entity` is not recommended.

```jsx
// not recomended
<Viewer>
  <Scene>
    <Camera>
      <Entity />
    </Camera>
  </Scene>
</Viewer>
```

```jsx
// recomended
<Viewer>
  <Scene />
  <Camera />
  <Entity />
</Viewer>
```

## Properties

Each components of resium have 4 kinds of properties as bellow.

### Cesium Properties

"Cesium property" is a property derived from Cesium. Each properties are correspond to a property of the cesium element. All "cesium properties" are variable, so when they are updated in React component, the corresponding properties will be updated seamlessly.

### Cesium Read Only Properties

"Cesium read only property" is also a property derived from Cesium, but it is immutable. They are available only when initializing the element.

**If "Cesium read only props" are changed in React component, the Cesium element will be destroyed and reinitialized.** It can be a cause of performance deterioration. Please use carefully to avoid changing as much as possible.

For example, `imageryProvider` property of `ImageryLayer` component is a "Cesium read only property". So in the following code, ImageryLayer is reinitialized in every rendering time!

```jsx
const Example = () => (
  <Viewer>
    <ImageryLayer
      imageryProvider={
        new ArcGisMapServerImageryProvider({
          url: "//services.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Street_Map/MapServer",
        })
      }
    />
  </Viewer>
);
```

If `imageryProvider` property is constant, The following is recommended.

```jsx
import { Viewer, ImageryLayer } from "resium";
import { ArcGisMapServerImageryProvider } from "cesium";

const imageryProvider = new ArcGisMapServerImageryProvider({
  url: "//services.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Street_Map/MapServer",
});

const ExampleComponent = () => (
  <Viewer>
    <ImageryLayer imageryProvider={imageryProvider} />
  </Viewer>
);
```

If `imageryProvider` property is variable, Using [memoize-one](https://github.com/alexreardon/memoize-one) module is one idea.

```jsx
import { Viewer, ImageryLayer } from "resium";
import { ArcGisMapServerImageryProvider } from "cesium";
import memoize from "memoize-one";

const imageryProvider = memoize(url => new ArcGisMapServerImageryProvider({ url }));

const ExampleComponent = ({ url }) => (
  <Viewer>
    <ImageryLayer imageryProvider={imageryProvider(url)} />
  </Viewer>
);
```

### Cesium events

"Cesium event" is a event propery of Cesium element. It can be used in the same way as normal React component events.

They are renamed according to React's custom. For example, `Viewer#trackedEntityChanged` => `onTrackedEntityChange`.

### Other props

Some components have convenient properties that do not exist in the Cesium element. They can be used in the same way as normal React component properties.

## Accessing to a Cesium element

If you want to access a Cesium element, use `ref` prop. It can be get by `cesiumElement` property of the component object that can be get by `ref`.

To know what is a Cesium element of each component, refer to "Cesium element" in the document of each component.

```jsx
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  let viewer; // Cesium.Viewer

  return (
    <Viewer
      ref={e => {
        viewer = !!e ? e.cesiumElement : undefined;
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

```jsx
class ExampleComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  entity = React.createRef(); // entity.current = Cesium.Entity

  render() {
    return (
      <Viewer>
        <Entity
          name="test"
          description="test!!"
          position={Cartesian3.fromDegrees(-74.0707383, 40.7117244, 100)}
          point={{ pixelSize: 10 }}
          ref={entity}
        />
      </Viewer>
    );
  }
}
```

## Limitations

- Server side rendering is not supported. Cesium is rendered in web browsers.
- Resium runs only with `react-dom`. because Cesium depends on APIs of web browsers (DOM, WebGL, Web Worker and so on). React Native is not supported.
